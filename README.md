# AboutMe
Hello! 
My name is Shreshtha Modi and I am a rising sophomore at Gujarat Technological University (Gujarat, India) studying Electronics and Communications Engineering.
For as long as I can remember, I dreamt of becoming a psychiatrist. The mysteries of human brain have fascinated me ever since my childhood. 
Entering Highschool and taking my first physics class, i fell in love with physics and the Maths behind it, which became my motivation to pursue my Bachelor's in Engineering.
Growing up, a lot of things changed but the more i think about it, the more i realize that i have always loved deciphering how things "worked" under the hood be it artifical circuits or human brains.
Upon graduating, i plan to go to school to get my Master's degree in either Neuroscience or Artifical Intelligence and I constantly strive to do contribute to field that lies at an inersection of the two fields that I am the most passionate about.
During my first year of College, I worked on a research project called "Analysis of Waterborne diesease" where we collected the water samples from various parts of my city and tried to determine the relation between waterquality and the outbreak of waterborne diseases in various zones of Ahmedabad
I am currently working on Analysis of the child labour data in Bangladesh hoping to find some meaningful insights! 
I would love to chat with you, please feel free to send an e-mail or a text!
